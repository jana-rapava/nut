[Unit]
# This unit starts early in system lifecycle to set up nut-driver instances
# and stays running as a loop to pick up any subsequent changes maybe more
# reliably than the filesystem notification processing would allow.
# End-user may also restart this unit after editing ups.conf to automatically
# un-register or add new instances as appropriate.

[Service]
### Script needs privileges to restart units
#User=@RUN_AS_USER@
#Group=@RUN_AS_GROUP@
User=root
# it is expected that the process has to exit before systemd starts follow-up
# units; it should not be a problem for those
Type=simple
# Currently systemd does not support restarting of oneshot services, and does
# not seem to guarantee that other services would only start after the script
# completes, for a non-oneshot case. The script itself handles restarting of
# nut-server which is the primary concerned dependency at the moment, so we
# don't want it to fail the unit (when it can't restart).
Restart=always
Environment=REPORT_RESTART_42=no
ExecStart=@NUT_LIBEXECDIR@/nut-driver-enumerator.sh --daemon
# Note: this is an async event, actual reconfiguration may take some time to
# complete after this signal.
